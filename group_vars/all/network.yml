## HA
CLUSTER_NAME: demok8s  # used only for defining the clusterConfiguration and joinConfiguration k8s config, as well as the below dnsDomain and masterha_fqdn

## ensure you have the DNS set for wildcard, and pointing all the trafic to master or similar setup
custom:
  networking:
    dnsDomain: "{{ CLUSTER_NAME }}.myk8s.corp.example.com"  # For MasterHA, if you have dns, put the desired cluster domain here. If no DNS change possible on your side, and you want MasterHA, fix the below 2 values accordinly

    ######
    ## masterha_* params are requried when you have MasterHA (meaning when your inventory has "secondary-masters" section not-empty)
    ## Your setup can either use a LoadBalancer (usually a hw one), 
    ## or use a VIP address which keepalived will manage (move the address from one master to another as needed)

    ## Decide on one of 2 the masterha_types possible:
    # "vip" #Choose VIP and you'll have keepalived instaleld and cofigured for the masterha_ip below.
    # "lb" #Choose lb when you have a MasterHA LB which load-balances across all your masters, on api port (default 6443) 
    #      # Make sure your LB is setup to forward requests to a specific master ONLY when api port /healthz on that host returns status 200 
    masterha_type: "lb" # "vip" # or "lb"
    masterha_ip: "10.1.2.3" #| default('') }}"  # Important when you have MasterHA;  # IP of either your LB or the VIP to be used.
    ## masterha_fqdn is usually the dns name of masterha_ip above. (We cannot get it automatically in ansible...)
    ## This value is important in order to set apiServerCertSANs in the certs correctly
    masterha_fqdn: "master-{{ CLUSTER_NAME }}.corp.example.com"  # Important when you have MasterHA, in order to set apiServerCertSANs correctly
    #masterha_fqdn: "{{ lookup('dig', masterha_ip, 'qtype=PTR') }}" # but requires some pip modules on host...

    #masterha_bindPort: 6443 #default is 6443; We recommend to keep it 6443.
    ### end of masterha topic

    ## When masterha_type is set to "vip", keepalived is deployed automatically. Options to deploy it via linux package (rpm/deb) or using a docker image.
    ## if you move from one type to another, please make sure you manually remove the previous setup 
    ## E.g. moving from package to docker, manually do: systemctl stop keepliaved; systemctl disable keepalived
    ## E.g. moving from docker to package, manually do: docker rm -f keepalived
    ## Can be either 'docker' or 'package' or 'provided' (when already installed outside of this playbook; this playbook will generate the configuration and check script)
    masterha_vip_keepalived_deploy_type: docker

      always: false # makes all the below true

      node: false   # when true, the join command will have --node-name set to fqdn. When false, k8s will set based on how node machine answers to the hostname command
